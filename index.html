    <h3>Want to <a href="mailto:donnambennett@att.net?Subject=Advertising%20on%20Finger%20Lakes%20Connected">advertise</a> on Finger Lakes Connected?</h3>
    <p><a href="mailto:donnambennett@att.net?Subject=Advertising%20on%20Finger%20Lakes%20Connected">Send us an email</a> to learn about our <em>very</em> affordable advertising rates. Remember our readership is 100% self-subscribed, so residents <em>want</em> to receive the weekly email.</p>



    <h3>What are we?</h3>
    <p>Finger Lakes Connected started as Canandaigua Connected in May 2009. Donna, a mother of three small children, felt frustrated not knowing when certain local events were happening. She gathered some Main Street events and combined them with the events at the library and other local places and put together a monthly email to friends, family, and neighbors. It has grown to a weekly self-subscribed publication with many advertisers from throughout our Finger Lakes Region that can be read on smartphones, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and (of course) our original platform of email. It is free for all residents to receive and is dependent upon YOU emailing in local events and happenings. Finger Lakes Connected is paid for by advertisers who want their ad to be seen!</p>
